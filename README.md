## Why

There are many ways to create React applications nowadays, and it is useful to have a look at different versions of the same app using different hooks, frameworks, libs, etc.

## Versions

### Static React apps (without api persistence)

1. with useState
2. with useReducer
3. with useReducer and Context
4. with old school redux (connect)
5. with redux hooks (useDispatch and useSelector)
6. with redux and more hooks (useMemo, useEffect, useCallback)
7. with modern redux (slices)

todo:

- with zustand
- with react-query

not to do but can be done:

- with immer-reducer
