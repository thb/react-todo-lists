# With useState

## About this version

In this version, we use useState to manage the tasks and the filter.

So everytime the user interacts (clicks, text sublmit, etc.) we have
a function 'handleAddTask' or 'handleChangeTask' or 'handleDeleteTask' that
updates the state directly (with setTasks or setFilter).
