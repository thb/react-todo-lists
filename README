# Todo List experiments

This is a simple todo list application that I am using to experiment with different React technologies. There are many ways to create
React applications nowadays, and there is the need for understanding how to use different technologies, frameworks, persistence, etc.

## Static React apps (without api persistence)

- with useState
- with useReducer
- with immer-reducer
- with old school redux
- with modern redux
- with zustand

## Static React apps with api persistence

- with redux + thunk oldschool
- with rtk
- with zustand
- with react-query
- with rtk query (pour le store + connection API)
- with nextjs + server actions

## Static React apps with api persistance and authentication

- with zustand (et un useAuth et useTasks)
- with react query
- with nextjs + server actions
- with nextjs + zustand + server actions
